<- BattleShip ----------------------------------------------------------------------
BattleShip offers an implementation of the ISpaceShip interface.
It come with a full set of get and set method to manipulate it's own daughter.
As it doesn't hold any attribute, it isn't of much use by itself.
The list of currently implemented method is as follow:
getName: return the name of the ship, as a string,
getPos: return an array filled with the straight coordinate of each part of
its hull, to retrieve its coordinate in a two dimensional space, clever use of
division and modulo associated with the constants defined in Battleground
should wonderfully do the job,
getSprite: return the color in wich the ship should be, as a string,
setPos: Allow to change the coordinate of the ship, taking as parameter
the distance travelled while facing in the same direction,
getZ: return the orientation of the ship, North, South, West or East sided,
setZ: Allow to change the orientation of the ship, clock and counter-clock wise,
getSpeed: returning the maximum distance a ship can travel during it's activation.
